# Movement Tracker

This extension can add simple colored rings to any Character image.

**How to use**

Select your character token/tokens and click the button![AddIcon](public\assets\contextMenu_add_icon.svg) to add them to the movement tracker, and get moving!

**A tool for both GM's and Players**

The tracker is designed to both help the GM with controlling the Enemies and NPC's, and Players controlling thier character, without spoiling the speed of the GM's Enemies. The GM has to option to privately track his enteties, which makes them only visible for him. His privately tracked entities will then have a different font color, and sorted at the top of his list, so the they are easily accesible for the GM to manage.
